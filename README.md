# Data-Analyst-Projects-Udacity
This contains all the **Projects** I embarked on during the course of my Data analyst Nanodegree program. 
The first project was on investigating a dataset where I was able to investigate a dataset containing no_show appointments of patients. This dataset contained the details of patients
that show up to appointments or not, and I was able to investigate several factors that affect of patients show up for appointments or not.
The second project was on **Data Wrngling** where I was able to analyze a twitter archive data and perform some wranglish operations and visualizations on it.
The third project was on **Data visualization** where I visualized the data of the ford GoBike services. I performed several types of visualizations. The project contained
both exploratory and explanatory data analysis.
